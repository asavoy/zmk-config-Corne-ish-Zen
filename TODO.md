# TODO

- Support the Rectangle Pro keyboard shortcuts better; maybe with Alt-Tab shortcuts too
- I shouldn't use the left-hand side Shift modifier, get rid of that
- Rework the symbols layer
  - Look at Rico's new keymap: https://github.com/rstacruz/my-zmk-config
  - Basically want to move some of the keys to be easier to remember:
  - binary opfs |&
  - calc ops `*+\-`
  - backslash; can never remember where that one is
- get zmk to build locally like: https://github.com/rstacruz/my-zmk-config/blob/main/Makefile
- updating to the latest ZMK and applying patches
  - longer timeout before sleep
  - quicker screen refresh
