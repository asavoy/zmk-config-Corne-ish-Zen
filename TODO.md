# TODO

- Support the Rectangle Pro keyboard shortcuts better; maybe with Alt-Tab shortcuts too
- I shouldn't use the left-hand side Shift modifier, get rid of that
- Rework the symbols layer
  - Look at Rico's new keymap: https://github.com/rstacruz/my-zmk-config
  - Basically want to move some of the keys to be easier to remember:
  - binary opfs |&
  - calc ops `*+\-`
  - backslash; can never remember where that one is
- [x] updating to the latest ZMK and applying patches
  - [x] reinit'ed from the zmk setup guide since corneish-zen is now upstream

- [x] see this config (which might require update to Zephyr 3.5): https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-config/blob/main/config/corneish_zen.conf
  - [x] try these instructions: https://gist.github.com/caksoylar/c411313990978e1903c244f03039187a
